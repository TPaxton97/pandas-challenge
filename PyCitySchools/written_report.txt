This report for PyCity Schools includes an analysis of information about each of the 15 high schools in the district
and their student bodies' test scores. The highest performing schools, lowest performing schools, and relationships 
between grade level, school spending, school size, school type, and students' passing rates for math and reading
are explored.

Based on the data, one observable trend the negative correlation between overall test passing rates and school spending 
per student, meaning that as school spending per student increases, overall passing rates decrease. This can be 
exemplified by the Scores by School Spending table which shows that the percentage of students who 
passed both math and reading is at 90% for schools that spent less that $585 per student, while the per of students 
who passed both math and reading is at 54% for schools that spent between $645 and $680 per student.

This suggests that spending more money per student would not improve test scores for this district.

Another observable trend is the significant drop in the overall test passing rates when school size exceeds 2,000
students. As seen in the Size Summary table, the percentage of students passing math and reading tests drops from
90% to 58% between medium school size (1000-2000 students) and large school size (2000-5000 students).

This suggests that school size could impact the academic success of its student body.

Although beyond the scope of this analysis, further questioning into the relationship between other factors related
to school size and student test scores (e.g. teacher:student ratio, existence of academic support programs) could 
inform PyCity Schools' development.
